# Cloud Patterns and Anti-Patterns
Building solutions designed to take advantage of the cloudâ€™s scale capabilities requires a change in thinking from how you might have designed the same solutions on-premises.  This session highlights common patterns, such as queue-based communication between dependencies, and highlights anti-patterns that limit performance and scale.
